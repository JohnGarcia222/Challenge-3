# Arbitrage Opportunities with Bistamp and Coinbase
------------------------
Within this coding project you will find a comparison between coinbase and bitstamp and their values between Janurary 1st 2018 and March 31st 2018. Using the code you can see a large spread of date representing whether or not a purchase is a viable/good option and if so when you would or should have bought in.

# Code Usage
---------------------
 Upon running the program you will see many spreads of data showing you every piece of information about the trades for bitstamp and coinbase between Janurary 1st 2018 and March 31st 2018. It is important to know that this code runs off of csv files that have been imported, therefore this code should not be changed for any other currency unless its statistics have been imported and the code has been altered.
